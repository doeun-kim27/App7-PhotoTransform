  Brief Description of Goal of Code:
In this App7, it will let users to take a picture and upload an image to the canvas.
(This image will be uploaded, transformed, and displayed on the canvas)
In addition, it will have two canvas page where:
- Where when the user loads an image, the first canvas will have unaltered image loaded
- And second canvas will display blue color of an image
 
  Known Issues:
This will be an useful tool for users to upload their images.
If this is incorporated into Diagnosis App, users can easily upload their photos of the symptoms and it will be halpful to give more precise diagnosis.
In addition, it can be also used for color blind diagnosis for patients.
